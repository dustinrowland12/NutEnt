The goal of this project is to learn and test different web technologies

Right now this app is designed to test different Spring/Hibernate technologies as well as other fun things. I'm hoping to continue contributing to this code to increase my skill set.

The site is now published on Heroku for testing and demonstration purposes: https://nutent.herokuapp.com/
